## User Guide

SOChedule is a one-stop solution for NUS School of Computing (SoC) students to manage their tasks and events effectively.
Targeted at users who can type fast and prefer typing to mouse input, SOChedule is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) 
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `SOChedule.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/releases/download/v1.3.1/SOChedule.jar).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SOChedule.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. A sample SOChedule is given below. There would not be pre-entered data on first launch so that users can immediately jump in and use.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list_task`** : Lists all tasks.

   * **`add_task`**`n/CS2103 assignment d/2021-04-07 p/1 c/schoolwork t/urgent` : Adds a task named `CS2103 assignment` to the SOChedule with its respective attributes. Please verify the validity of the date parameter.

   * **`delete_task`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `undone_task INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter which can be used as `undone_task 1`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/TASKNAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Quiz t/CS2103` or as `n/Quiz`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/1 p/2`, only `p/2` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list_task`, `list_event`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list_task 123`, it will be interpreted as `list_task`.

    * Should there be two or more pinned tasks, the pinned tasks will be sorted as well.
    * Only the fact that pinned tasks will appear over the unpinned tasks is guaranteed. Internal order of pinned tasks is not persistent over `sort_task`.
* Pinned tasks are persistent over instances of SOChedule.

Examples:
