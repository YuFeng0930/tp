## 1. Preface
SOChedule is a one-stop solution for managing tasks and events, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  

The Developer Guide for Sochedule is designed to showcase the high level architecture systems used to design and implement Sochedule.

The link to the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp).

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.
 
</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_task 1`.

![Architecture Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 3.3 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `SocheduleParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task or an event).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete_task 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_task 1` Command](images/DeleteTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteTaskCommandParser`should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)  

### 3.4 Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the Sochedule data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>`that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** An (arguably) more OOP model can store a `Tag` list and a `Category` list in the `Sochedule`, which `Task` and `Event` can refer.
This allows `Sochedule` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, and one `Category` object per unique `Object`, 
instead of each `Task` and `Event` needing their own `Tag` and `Category` object.<br>

</div>

#### 3.4.1 Design considerations for Task-related Models
When implementing Task-related models, it is important to avoid adding duplicate tasks. 
For example, it is undesirable for users to add the same task, completing CS2103 Quiz before 2021-06-01, twice into the task list. 
Because these two tasks contain the same information and can potentially cause confusion for users 
when he completes one and finds another task with the same description still left uncompleted.

In our application, we require users to minimally provide the name, deadline and priority when creating a task.
To ensure duplicates are handled, our team went through several alternatives and here are our considerations.

* Alternative 1 (Chosen Implementation): `equals(Task task)` method should check if the name, priority, deadline, 
  tags (if any) and categories (if any) are equal.
  * Pros:  
    * Tasks with same name but different deadline, priority and/or any other fields are allowed.
  * Cons:
    * Harder to implement.
* Alternative 2 : `equals(Task task)` method should check for the equality of task name only.
    * Pros:
        * Easier to implement.
        * Ensure that the task names are always distinct.
    * Cons:
        * Less flexibility and may not meet some users' need because task with same name but other different fields are not allowed.

We chose Alternative 1 because it is more flexible and suitable for users' need. 
There can be multiple tasks with same name but other different fields, like deadlines. 
For example, a user may need to create two tasks with the same name '2103 quiz',
but one is due on this Monday and the other is due the next Monday. Both of these 2 tasks should be allowed in our task list.

#### 3.4.2 Design considerations for Event-Related Models
Similar to Task-related Models, we face the same challenge when choosing between checking for the equality of name only and 
checking for all fields entered by the user. We chose to check for all fields for the same reasons as mentioned above.

### 3.5 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Sochedule data in json format and read it back.

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## 4 Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how [Sochedule](#41-sochedule), [Task](#42-task) and [Event](#43-event) are implemented.

### 4.1 Sochedule

#### 4.1.1 Overview

#### 4.1.2 Implementation

**Implementation of ClearCommand**  
The following is a detailed explanation on how ClearCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `clear` command to clear task and event lists.
An `ClearCommandParser` object is created, and the `ClearCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
A `ClearCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `ClearCommand#execute()`, `Model#setSochedule(new Sochedule())` is called.
This will replace Sochedule data with a new empty Sochedule.
For brevity, lower level implementation is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_SUCCESS`.

The sequence diagram for `ClearCommand` can be found below.

![Sequence Diagram of Clear Command](images/ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)  

**Implementation of SummaryCommand**  
The following is a detailed explanation on how SummaryCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `summary` command to get a summary of the current completion status of tasks and events.
An `SummaryCommandParser` object is created, and the `SummaryCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
A `SummaryCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `SummaryCommand#execute()`, `Model#getNumCompletedTask()`,
`Model#getFilteredTaskList()`,
`Model#getNumOverdueTask()`,
`Model#getNumIncompleteTask()`,
`Model#getNumIncomingEvents()` are called.
This will get different statistics on task and event completion.
For brevity, lower level implementation is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_SUCCESS`.

The sequence diagram for `SummaryCommand` can be found below.

![Sequence Diagram of Summary Command](images/SummaryCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)  

**Implementation of FindScheduleCommand**  
The following is a detailed explanation on how SummaryCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `find_schedule DATE` command to find the ongoing tasks and events before or on the given date.
An `FindScheduleCommandParser` object is created, and the `FindScheduleCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method conducts parses the `DATE` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
Two predicates, `TaskFindSchedulePredicate(Date date)` and `EventFindSchedulePredicate(Date date)` are created based on the given date.
Then, a `FindScheduleCommand` object is created given the two predicates and returned.

**Step 2**: On `FindScheduleCommand#execute()`, 
`Model#updateFilteredTaskList(TaskFindSchedulePredicate taskPredicate)` 
and `Model#updateFilteredEventList(EventFindSchedulePredicate eventPredicate)` are called.
This will update the task list to only show the uncompleted tasks with deadline before or on the given date.
Similary, the event list will be updated to only show the events with start date before or on the given date and end date after or on the given date.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(TaskFindSchedulePredicate taskPredicate)` 
and `Model#updateFilteredEventList(EventFindSchedulePredicate eventPredicate)` are omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_FIND_SCHEDULE_SUCCESS`.

The sequence diagram for `FindScheduleCommand` can be found below.

![Sequence Diagram of FindSchedule Command](images/FindScheduleCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** Due to the size constraint, the argument `taskPredicate` is not shown in the sequence diagram 
when calling the method `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(TaskFindSchedulePredicate taskPredicate)`.
Same for the method `Model#updateFilteredEventList(EventFindSchedulePredicate eventPredicate)`.
</div>

### 4.2 Task

#### 4.2.1 Overview

#### 4.2.2 Implementation

**Implementation of AddTaskCommand**
The following is a detailed explanation on how AddTaskCommand is implemented.

**Step1**: User executes `add_task n/TASKNAME d/DEADLINE p/PRIORITY [c/CATEGORY]... [t/TAG]...` command to add the 
specific task with given arguments. An `AddTaskCommandParser` object is created, and the 
`AddTaskParser#parse(String args)` method is called. The method conducts parses the `args` and conducts validation
checks to ensure that it compiles with the specification. An `AddTaskCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `AddTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#addTasks(Task taskToAdd)` is called.
This will add the task specified into the task list.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#addTasks(Task taskToAdd)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_ADD_TASK_SUCCESS`.
The UI will also update as the underlying task list has been modified.

The sequence diagram for `AddTaskCommand` can be found below.

![Sequence Diagram of AddTask Command](images/AddTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)  

**Implementation of DeleteTaskCommand**  
The following is a detailed explanation on how DeleteTaskCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `delete_task Index` command to delete the task at the given index.
A `DeleteTaskParser` object is created, and the `DeleteTaskParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method conducts parses the `args` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
A `DeleteTaskCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `DeleteTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#deleteTasks(Task taskToDelete)` is called.
This will delete the task at the specified index.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#deleteTasks(Task taskToDelete)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_DELETE_TASK_SUCCESS`.
The UI will also update as the underlying task list has been modified.

The sequence diagram for `DeleteTaskCommand` can be found below.

![Sequence Diagram of DeleteTask Command](images/DeleteTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)  

**Implementation of UndoneTaskCommand**  
The following is a detailed explanation on how UndoneTaskCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `undone_task Index` command to mark the completed task at the given index as uncompleted. 
Let us call this task the target task.
A `UndoneTaskCommandParser` object is created, and the `UndoneTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method conducts parses the `args` and conducts validation checks to ensure that the given index is a valid unsigned non-zero integer.
A `UndoneTaskCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `UndoneTaskCommand#execute()`, the index is further checked to ensure it is not out of range (i.e. larger than the size of task list)
and the target task is indeed a completed task.
Afterwards, `UndoneTaskCommand#createUncompletedTask()` method is called.
This method copies the information of the target task and creates an uncompleted task with exactly the same information as the target task.
Finally, `Model#setTask(Task taskToUndone, Task uncompletedTask)` and `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS)` method are called.
These two methods updates the target task in the task list and refresh the UI to show the update.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `UndoneTaskCommand#createUncompletedTask()`, 
`Model#setTask(Task taskToUndone, Task uncompletedTask)`, `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS)` are omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_UNDONE_TASK_SUCCESS`.

The sequence diagram for `UndoneTaskCommand` can be found below.

![Sequence Diagram of UndoneTask Command](images/UndoneTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** Due to the size constraint, the argument `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS` is not shown in the sequence diagram 
when calling the method `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS)`.
</div>

**Implementation of EditTaskCommand**  
The following is a detailed explanation on how EditTaskCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `Edit_task Index` command to Edit the task at the given index.
An `EditTaskCommandParser` object is created, and the `EditTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method conducts parses the `args` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
An `EditTaskDescriptor` object is created, and it contains all the field an Task needed. 
If the field is edited, then store the edited one; otherwise, store the original value.
An `EditTaskCommand` object (with the `EditTaskDescriptor` as a parameter) is returned.

**Step 2**: On `EditTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#getFilteredTaskList()` and 
`Model#createEditedTask(Task taskToEdit, EditTaskDescriptor editTaskDescriptor)` are called.
These will create the edited Task. Then, `Model#setTask(Task taskToEdit, Task editedTask)` and 
`Model#updateFilteredTaskList()` are called. These will update the edited Task into the task list.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message `EditTaskCommand#MESSAGE_EDIT_TASK_SUCCESS` will be displayed.

The UI will also update as the underlying task list has been modified.

The sequence diagram for `EditTaskCommand` can be found below.

![Sequence Diagram of EditTask Command](images/EditTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)  

**Implementation of SortTaskCommand**  
The following is a detailed explanation on how SortTaskCommand is implemented in the Logic component.

**Step 1**: User executes `sort SORT_VAR` command to sort the tasks based on the `SORT_VAR` provided.
An `SortTaskCommandParser` object is created, and the `SortTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called. 
The method conducts parses the `SORT_VAR` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
A `SortTaskCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `SortTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#sortTasks(String comparingVar)` is called.
This will cause the task list to sort itself, based on the provided `comparingVar`.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#sortTasks(String comparingVar)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_SORT_TASK_SUCCESS`.
The UI will also update as the underlying task list has been modified.

The sequence diagram for `sortTaskCommand` can be found below.

Our group decided to go with alternative 1 and implemented an additional sort comparator known as `TaskComparator`.
This is to ensure smoother UX, as well as better integration with other commands.

By implementing it in this way, our group is able to ensure that the sort order remains consistent over commands that could either:
* Alter the number of tasks shown at any one time (See <code>find_task</code>)</li>
* Change the order of task appearance independent of <code>sort_task</code> (See <code>pin_task</code>)</li>

This would enable SOChedule to better serve the needs of its user base.

**Implementation of PinTaskCommand/UnpinTaskCommand**  
The following is a detailed explanation on how PinTaskCommand is implemented.
UnpinTaskCommand is largely similar in implementation to PinTaskCommand and will be omitted for brevity.

**Step 1**: User executes `pin_task INDEX` command to pin the task at the given index.
An `PinTaskCommandParser` object is created, and the `PinTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method conducts parses the `args` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
A `PinTaskCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `PinTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#pinTask(Task task)` is called.
This will pin the task at the specified index.
Subsequently, the underlying task list will be sorted by calling `Model#sortTasksDefault()`, with pinned tasks being first in priority, followed by the last sorted variable 
(if `sort_task` was not called before, task list will be sorted by name).
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#pinTask(Task task)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_PIN_TASK_SUCCESS`.
The UI will also update as the underlying task list has been modified.

The sequence diagram for `PinTaskCommand` can be found below.
It is largely similar to `SortTaskCommand`, with a some minor differences:
* Instead of `SortTask`-related parsers and commands, `PinTask`-related parsers and commands are created and activated.
* Additional call to `Model#sortTaskDefault()` after `Model#pinTask(Task)`

![Sequence Diagram of PinTaskCommand](images/PinTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

The below activity diagram summarises what happens when `pin_task` is called.
It can also be similarly extrapolated to apply to `unpin_task`.

**Implementation of ClearCompletedTaskCommand**  
The following is a detailed explanation on how ClearCompletedTaskCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `clear_completed_task` command to clear completed tasks in task list.
A `ClearCompletedTaskCommand` object is created and returned.

**Step 2**: On `ClearCompletedTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#clearCompletedTasks()` is called.
This will delete all ticked tasks (all completed tasks).
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#clearCompletedTasks()` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message `ClearCompletedTaskCommand#MESSAGE_CLEAR_COMPLETED_TASK_SUCCESS` will be displayed.

The sequence diagram for `ClearCompletedTaskCommand` can be found below.

**Implementation of ClearExpiredTaskCommand**  
The following is a detailed explanation on how ClearExpiredTaskCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `clear_completed_task` command to clear completed tasks in task list.
A `ClearExpiredTaskCommand` object is created and returned.

**Step 2**: On `ClearExpiredTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#clearExpiredTasks()` is called.
This will delete all expired tasks whose deadline have already past.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#clearExpiredTasks()` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message `ClearExpiredTaskCommand#MESSAGE_CLEAR_EXPIRED_TASK_SUCCESS` will be displayed.

**Implementation of AddEventCommand**
The following is a detailed explanation on how AddEventCommand is implemented.

**Step1**: User executes `add_event n/TASKNAME sd/STARTDATE st/STARTTIME ed/ENDDATE et/ENDTIME [c/CATEGORY]... [t/TAG]...` 
command to add the specific event with given arguments. An `AddEventCommandParser` object is created, and the 
`AddEventParser#parse(String args)` method is called. The method conducts parses the `args` and conducts validation
checks to ensure that it compiles with the specification. An `AddEventCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `AddEventCommand#execute()`, `Model#addEvents(Event eventToAdd)` is called.
This will add the event specified into the event list.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#addEvents(Event eventToAdd)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message `AddEventCommand#MESSAGE_ADD_EVENT_SUCCES` will be displayed.
The UI will also update as the underlying event list has been modified.

The sequence diagram for `AddEventCommand` can be found below.

**Implementation of DeleteEventCommand**  
The following is a detailed explanation on how DeleteEventCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `delete_event Index` command to delete the event at the given index.
A `DeleteEventParser` object is created, and the `DeleteEventParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method conducts parses the `args` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
A `DeleteEventCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `DeleteEventCommand#execute()`, `Model#deleteEvents(Event eventToDelete)` is called.
This will delete the event at the specified index.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#deleteEvents(Event eventToDelete)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message `DeleteEventCommand#MESSAGE_DELETE_EVENT_SUCCESS` will be displayed.
The UI will also update as the underlying event list has been modified.

The sequence diagram for `DeleteEventCommand` can be found below.

**Implementation of EditEventCommand**  
The following is a detailed explanation on how EditEventCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `Edit_event Index` command to Edit the event at the given index.
An `EditEventParser` object is created, and the `EditEventParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method conducts parses the `args` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
An `EditEventDescriptor` object is created, and it contains all the field an Event needed. 
If the field is edited, then store the edited one; otherwise, store the original value.
An `EditEventCommand` object (with the `EditEventDescriptor` as a parameter) is returned.

**Step 2**: On `EditEventCommand#execute()`, `Model#getFilteredEventList()` and 
`Model#createEditedEvent(Event eventToEdit, EditEventDescriptor editEventDescriptor)` are called.
These will create the edited Event. Then, `Model#setEvent(Event eventToEdit, Event editedEvent)` and 
`Model#updateFilteredEventList()` are called. These will update the edited Event into the event list.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message `EditEventCommand#MESSAGE_EDIT_TASK_SUCCESS` will be displayed.
The UI will also update as the underlying event list has been modified.

The sequence diagram for `EditEventCommand` can be found below.

**Implementation of FindFreeTimeCommand**  
The following is a detailed explanation on how FindFreeTaskCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `free_time DATE` command to find free time slots in the given day.
An `FindFreeTimeCommandParser` object is created, and the `FindFreeTimeCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method conducts parses the `args` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
A `FindFreeTimeCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `FindFreeTimeCommand#execute()`, `Model#getFreeTimeSlots(Date date)` is called.
This will get free time slots and store in a string arraylist.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#getFreeTimeSlots(Date date)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_FIND_FREE_TIME_SUCCESS`.

The sequence diagram for `FindFreeTimeCommand` can be found below.

![Sequence Diagram of FindFreeTimeCommand](images/FindFreeTimeCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The below activity diagram summarises what happens when `free_time` is called.

We choose alternative 1 because it presents code in a clearer way. Breaking up long methods into shorter methods will improve
readability of the code. Implementing codes under UniqueEventList also reduces dependency.
